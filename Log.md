- Wrote <a href="https://github.com/beef-erikson/CleanCode/blob/master/src/IntentionRevealingNames.java">this</a>
about the importance of writing revealing names. 
- Avoid disinformation when naming. For example, you wouldn't want to use
accountList if it isn't actually a list. Spell similar concepts similarly.
This aids in auto-completion. i.e. CreateSquare, CreateCircle
- Make meaningful distinctions. Don't use noise words, numbered naming, or
redundant naming (for instance the word table should never appear in a table
name). a1, a2, a3 are terrible. moneyAmount is indistinguishable from Customer.money.
- Wrote <a href="https://github.com/beef-erikson/CleanCode/blob/master/src/PronounceableNames.java">
this</a> to demonstrate making names pronounceable.
